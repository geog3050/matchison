geog3050/matchison - Aitchison, Michael

I am a graduate student currently obtaining a Certificate in Geoinformatics from the University of Iowa. My prior education includes a Bachelor of Business in Economics from Western Illinois University, and a Master of Public Affairs (with a concentration in Sustainability and Sustainable Development) from the Paul H. Oâ€™Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs at Indiana University. My passion is for improving communities and ecosystems through data analysis. More specifically, I am interested in identifying effective policies for developing sustainable transportation systems and green infrastructure (e.g. street trees, parklets, and bioswales) at the local government level. In my spare time, I play the French horn and the piano; I enjoy classical, jazz, R&B, rock, and folk music, as well as improvisational works.

This is my GEOG 5055 Github Repository, containing all of the homework, quizes, project, and other data for the Geospatial Programming course.
